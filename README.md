**Description of the Animal Guessing Game:**

The Animal Guessing Game is an interactive and educational program that employs a binary tree structure to guess animals based on user input. It offers a dynamic and evolving gaming experience, as it learns new animals and distinguishing questions from user interactions.

   - The program keeps track of both questions and animals learned, forming a binary tree structure.

3. **Learning:**
